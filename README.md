# Overview

Clicking on the Notes.html will open the application. It will have a prompt of a menu to run through. You can add notes, delete notes and list out the notes you have made one by one. 

I made this application to get a better look into the Typescript language
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
